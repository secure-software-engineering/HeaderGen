    "  >>> y = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])\n",

    "  >>> plot(x1, y1, 'bo')\n",
    "  >>> plot(x2, y2, 'go')\n",
    "\n",
    "- If *x* and/or *y* are 2D arrays a separate data set will be drawn\n",
    "  for every column. If both *x* and *y* are 2D, they must have the\n",
    "  same shape. If only one of them is 2D with shape (N, m) the other\n",
    "  must have length N and will be used for every data set m.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  >>> x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  >>> y = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])\n",
    "  >>> plot(x, y)\n",

    "  >>> for col in range(y.shape[1]):\n",
    "  ...     plot(x, y[:, col])\n",
    "\n",

    "  >>> plot(x1, y1, 'g^', x2, y2, 'g-')\n",

    "  must have length N and will be used for every data set m.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  >>> x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  >>> y = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])\n",

    "  >>> for col in range(y.shape[1]):\n",
    "  ...     plot(x, y[:, col])\n",

    "  >>> plot(x1, y1, 'g^', x2, y2, 'g-')\n",

    "  >>> x = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "  >>> y = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])\n",

    "pandas - a powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python\n",
    "=====================================================================\n",
    "\n",
    "**pandas** is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data\n",
    "structures designed to make working with \"relational\" or \"labeled\" data both\n",
    "easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for\n",
    "doing practical, **real world** data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has\n",
    "the broader goal of becoming **the most powerful and flexible open source data\n",
    "analysis / manipulation tool available in any language**. It is already well on\n",
    "its way toward this goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main Features\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Easy handling of missing data in floating point as well as non-floating\n",
    "    point data.\n",
    "  - Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and\n",
    "    higher dimensional objects\n",
    "  - Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned\n",
    "    to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let\n",
    "    `Series`, `DataFrame`, etc. automatically align the data for you in\n",
    "    computations.\n",
    "  - Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine\n",
    "    operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data.\n",
    "  - Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python\n",
    "    and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects.\n",
    "  - Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large\n",
    "    data sets.\n",
    "  - Intuitive merging and joining data sets.\n",
    "  - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets.\n",
    "  - Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick).\n",
    "  - Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited),\n",
    "    Excel files, databases, and saving/loading data from the ultrafast HDF5\n",
    "    format.\n",
    "  - Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency\n",
    "    conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging.\n",
